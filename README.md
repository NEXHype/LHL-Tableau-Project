# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The goals of this project was select, load, and visualize a dataset with meaningfull viualizations in Tableau which could be used to anwswer question and gain insight about the data, and also creating a dashboard to display the visualizations and insisghts.

## Process
### Chose option 2 for the project and selected the FIFA 18 player ratings database
### Loaded the data into Tableau, and created 5 different viualizations which could be used to anwswer question and gain insight about the data
### Created an interactive dashboard with the visualizations to present the insights
### Created a story of the visualizations for easier presentation

## Results
Option 2 was chosing for this project, and the FIFA 18 player ratings datasset was chosen. 5 different visualizations were created including a bar graph of the highest overall rated players, a world map displaying the amount of players from each nation, a treemap showing the top nations with the most amount of developing young players, a pie chart of the most valuable players in the FIFA 18, and a line graph of the relationship between the value of a player to a club and the wage that they actually get paid. These visualizations can be used to answer questions about a players basic information in the game, as well as questions about the best footballing nations in the world back in 2017-2018 (when this game was released), and gain insight on how much money professional football players make. These visualzations where then put into an interactive dashboard where the map can be used to filter information on all the other visualization based on the nation.

## Challenges 
The biggest challenge in this project was that in order to create a map, the data type of the "nationality" column had to be transformed the role of "country/region", but Tableau public does not specify the U.K countries (England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland) as their own countries, and can only group them into the entire region of the United Kingdom, and the geographical role of "NUTS Europe" couldn't be used since there were players from all over the world, and not just one region.

## Future Goals
If i had more time, i would try to find a workaround to the geographical role issue to try and display each U.K country seperately on the map, or go back and manipulate the data set so that all the countries would match properly in Tableau so each country would be displayed properly.
